Social media web app for sharing gift wish lists with friends.

You can share gifts, add friends, create events, comments, questions, secret gift exchanges and much more!

The app has i18n support and dark mode.

I used Supabase for authentication, storage and database.

You need to sign up to use the app, but you can't also contact me for a live demo or a dummy account.
