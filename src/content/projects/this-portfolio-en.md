I started working in my new portfolio because i wanted something that was mobile-firts, simple to use and very direct.

At the end of the day, I think this is what recruiters normally look for.

I'm very proud of the design I've crafted in a neobrutalist style with my own touches.

Since it's only Astro and doesn't have lots of unused code, it's fast to load and easy to navigate.
