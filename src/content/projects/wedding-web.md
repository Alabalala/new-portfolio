Website for a wedding event.

The website has some custom animations made with Tailwind and CSS, with 3D effects and cool transitions.

All the designs, illustrations and drawings were also made by me.

There's a working form to RSVP for the wedding. The info is sent to Firebase and the couple can access, edit and delete it in a dashboard created only for them, with a login access. They can also create groups and organise guests.

I used playwright to test the website's forms.
