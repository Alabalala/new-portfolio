## 🎨 Design

Something about me, I love designing things from scratch.

Here you can find some illustrations made by me on Figma. 

I chose this particular color palette to reflect my personality and style.

The style is **neobrutalist** with some moder touches. I wanted something that fel modern and clean but at the same time playful and nice-to-look-at.
